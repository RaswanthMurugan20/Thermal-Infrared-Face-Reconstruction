During the night or in poorly lit areas, thermal cameras are a better choice instead of normal cameras for security surveillance because they do not rely on illumination. A thermal camera is able to detect a person within its view, but identification from only thermal information is not an easy task. To help with this task Canonical Correlation Analysis(CCA) based methods are used to reconstruct an image in thermal infrared spectrum can be reconstructed in visible spectrum. 

In the above jupyter-notebook a 2 step thermal-to-visible-spectrum reconstruction method based on CCA is implemented. This implementation closely follows the ideas in 
[Kresnaraman et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851082/).
